	<h1>Megaman X</h1>

</div>




<div>
	
	<p>X was designed and created by Dr. Light to be a robot who could think and make his own decisions without programming limitations. Unique among all of Dr. Light's creations, X possessed incredible physical and reasoning capabilities. However, Light feared that, since X didn't have any moral programming to dictate his morality or actions, he could become a grave threat to the world. Therefore, he sealed X away into a special capsule that would test his systems in a myriad of scenarios designed to ensure that X would be able to discern right from wrong and be always willing to do the right thing. Apparently, this process would take more than 30 years, and Light was very old and would not live to see X leave the capsule and enter the world. He left a warning on the computer in the lab he placed the capsule in and ordered anyone that may find the capsule to not release the robot within until his testing was complete.

	Maverick Hunter X, the 2006 remake of the original Mega Man X, shows a slightly different series of events. The Day of Î£, an unlockable prologue OVA included on the UMD, shows Dr. Light speaking with X several times during his creation, while in the SNES game Light sealed X away without activating him once. Furthermore, Light's intention of sealing X was different in Maverick Hunter X. Instead of fearing that X would become a threat because of his immaturity, Light feared that it would be the humans who were immature and not ready to live together with a robot as similar to a human as X would be by the time he finished his work. Instead, Light wanted him to fight for the people of the future and guide them to peace and happiness.

	X is a hot-blooded, committed, and strong-willed robot who has little tolerance for injustice. Though X fights with all his might against Sigma and his Mavericks, he is a pacifist at heart, something he might have inherited from the original Mega Man or Dr. Light. X would like nothing more than the fighting to be over, and for humans and Reploids to coexist peacefully next to each other, like his creator had always wished. He cares deeply for the victims of the war and for his friends who've fought so long with him, especially Zero, whom he regards as his best friend. X is easily frustrated when things go awry and rarely seems to understand the true motives of Sigma and other Mavericks.

	Although he's constantly conflicted with the battles he must fight, he eventually begins to come to terms with it and understands that he must indeed fight for the peace he desires to be a reality. This change is best seen during the Zero series in where the relationship between the two is reversed as it is X the one who actually supports Zero and encourages him to fight when either confused or doubtful in his actions.</p>

<p>X appears as himself in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite as a playable character. [11]. Unlike Zero, X primarily uses punches and kicks for his normals. His X Buster is a separate command and locks him in place when charging, though he is not entirely immobile as he can immediately follow up the attack with either a dash or an overhead smash. He has access to weapons from several games such as the Boomerang Cutter, Rising Fire and Sonic Slicer. He can fire any of these weapons twice in a row or fire one and cancel into another weapon to enhance his projectile game. His Hypers include a Charged Shot that comes out instantly. His Armor of Light has him don the First Armor from the first game, which increases his speed and power while at the same time enhancing his Charged Shot Hyper to fire off a double Charge Shot. His Lv. 3 equips the Ultimate Armor from X5 to hit nearby opponents which he then launches them into the air and fires off a Nova Strike-style projectile. His alternate costumes thus far are his armor from Command Mission and a new outfit called X Special, which is based on the TruForce redesign of X initially used as an April Fool's joke.

The game starts in Xgard, a fusion of Abel City and Asgard. While everyone else is fulfilling their mission to retrieve a special person who knows about the Infinity Stones (Thanos), X and Thor are fighting against Ultron Sigma's army of Xgardians and Drones. Both men lamented on the damage Ultron Sigma has done overall. When Ultron Sigma finally appears, the team tries to take him on, but to no successful avail. Captain America boosts X up for a direct attack on Sigma, but Sigma easily blocked it and knocked X down. Ultron Sigma was about to slice a downed X, but Iron Man blasts Ultron Sigma on time, only for Iron Man to get knocked down. With the team assembled, Doctor Strange creates a portal to escape.

The team regroups at Avengers Tower to discuss their plan of attack. With Thanos in their captivity, they use his information to track down the four other Infinity Stones, spread across various parts of the merged universes. X is assigned to locate the Power Stone, which is powering the core of Knowmoon. With Rocket Raccoon, the two advance to retrieve the stone while Strider Hiryu and Gamora serve as a distraction, but before they can go any further, they are confronted by a reprogrammed Zero. They manage to defeat him, undoing the rewriting altogether, though they stay behind to tend to his battle damage while the others go to confront the one ruling Knowmoon, Grandmaster Meio. X, Rocket and Zero soon arrive after his defeat. After taking a look at the monitor, X discovers that the core contains the Sigma Virus itself, doubling as a possible weapon. Though X is ordered to take the Power Stone, he hesitates, but Rocket takes it immediately without a second thought. Unfortunately, this causes the core to dislodge from the moon and on a collision course for New Metro City where the rest of the heroes are fighting. Despite the combined efforts of X, Nova and Captain Marvel, they are unable to damage it or slow its descent and are forced to retreat to Avengers' Tower. Thanos hatches a plan to kill two birds with one stone. He teaches Iron Man, X and Zero how to harness the Mind, Time and Power Stones acquired to destroy both the Moon and the symbiote monster plaguing the city. Though they succeed, the destruction of the moon releases the Sigma Virus with the heroes at the epicenter of it, infecting everyone. They consult Dr. Light, but he is unable to deduce a way to slow or halt the process, the only possible solution being the destruction of Ultron Sigma himself. Reunited, X and Zero gear up together for the fight ahead while Iron Man and Thanos get to work on building a weapon that could deal a decisive blow to the robot tyrant.

Taking the fight to Xgard once more, X, Zero and the others manage to finally break into the stronghold to confront Ultron Sigma in his lair, but not before they have to deal with a Sigma Virus-infected Thor.</p>
